# Class: Channel

The `Channel` class describes data streams on the connection.

## `channel.subscribePeers(callback)`

This method subscribes to the `online` and `offline` state of other peers in this channel. It takes in one parameter:

- `callback`: A callback function that will be called when peers changes.
    - `peers`: An array of peers.

The callback function will be invoked when someone joins or leaves this channel.

### Example

The following example logs the online peers in the channel:

```jsx
channel.subscribePeers((peers) => {
  peers.forEach((peer) => {
    console.log(peer + " is online")
  }
});
```

## `channel.broadcast(evt, payload)`

This method broadcasts my state changes to other peers in this channel with the specified `evt` handle. Peers can subscribe to this `evt` to observe the `payload`. It takes in two parameters:
- `evt`: The event name.
- `payload`: The payload to be sent.

Broadcast my state changes to other peers in this channel with `evt` handle. Peers can [subscribe](#subscribe) to this `evt` to observe the `payload`.

### Example

The following example broadcasts the `document.hidden` state of a user to all other peers in this channel:

```jsx {3}
const cb = () => {
  const state = document.hidden ? 'away' : 'online';
  c.broadcast('hidden-state-change', { state });
};
document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', cb)
```

## `channel.subscribe(evt, callback)`
This method subscribes to state changes with the given event name `evt`. It takes in two parameters:
- `evt`: The event name.
- `callback`: A callback function that will be called when the event is received.
    - `payload`: The payload sent by the peer.
    - `peerState`: The peer state.

The `callback` function will be invoked when another peer broadcasts with the same event name.

### Example

The following example subscribes to the `hidden-state-change` event from other peers:

```jsx {3-4}
channel.subscribe(
  'hidden-state-change',
  ({ payload, peer }) => {
    console.log(`${peer.id} change visibility to: ${payload}`)
  }
)
```

By using the `Presence` class and `joinChannel` , `Channel` class and its methods, developers can create real-time web applications with the ability to subscribe to data streams and broadcast data to peers in a secure, low-latency, and high-performance geo-distributed architecture.
