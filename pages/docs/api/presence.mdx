# Class: Presence

The `Presence` class manages the connection between the browser and the backend server, supporting both `WebTransport` and `WebSocket` at the same time.

## `createPresence(url[,option])`

This method creates a new instance of the `Presence` class. It takes in two parameters:
- `url`: The endpoint of the backend service which client connect to.
- `option`:
    - `publicKey`: The authentication string to connect to backend.
    - `id`: Current user client id.
    - `debug`: default is `false`, set to `true` to logs to browser's Dev Tools.
    - `autoDowngrade`: default is `false`, set to `true` will try to connect by `WebSocket` after `WebTransport` connection creation failed.
- Return: `<Promise>` containing `Presence` object.

Create a `Presence` instance which manage the connection from browser to backend.

Note that `WebTransport` is the default transport for `Presencejs`, but there are two scenarios where users can not enjoy it:

1. User's web browser is other than `Chrome` or `Microsoft Edge`.
2. User's network condition limited UDP connections.

`Presencejs` detects these situations automatically. When `autoDowngrade` is turned on, it will retry connecting to the backend service through `WebSocket`.

### Example

The following example creates a connection to a local development backend service called `[prscd](/prscd/introduction)` at `https://lo.yomo.dev:8443/v1`, with both `WebTransport` and `WebSocket` supported.

```jsx
import Presence from '@yomo/presence';

// create an instance.
const presencePromise = createPresence('https://lo.yomo.dev:8443/v1', {
  publicKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PRESENCE_PUBLIC_KEY,
  id: 'user-client-id',
  debug: true,
});

presencePromise.then((presence) => {
  console.log('Presence: ', presence);
});

// or
// (async () => {
//   const presence = await presencePromise;
// })()
```

  `lo.yomo.dev` always points to `127.0.0.1`, so you can use it for local development.

## `presence.joinChannel(id, initState)`

This method is used to join a channel and create a `Channel` instance. It takes in two parameters:

- `id`: The id of the channel to join.
- `initState`: Sync user's initial state to other peers.

This method tells other peers in this `[Channel](/interface/channel)` that this user is online with an initial state.

### Example

The following example observes a channel named `landing` to get which page other peers are currently on:

```jsx
const channel = presence.joinChannel('landing', { currentOn : '/docs/getting-stated' });
```
