# Generate TLS certificates for Anycast IP

This tutorial shows you how to generate TLS certificates for Anycast IP by certbot on your dev machine, assume we have a domain `realtime.example.com`, it is an [Anycast IP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/anycast-network/). By this, we can deploy `prscd` service on multiple nodes with the Geo-distributed architecture, users from different geo-location can connect to the nearest node to get the best performance.

## Prerequisites

install [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) on your dev machine:

```bash
brew install certbot 
```

## Generate TLS certificates by DNS challenge

```bash
sudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns -d realtime.example.com

Would you be willing, once your first certificate is successfully issued, to
share your email address with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a founding
partner of the Let's Encrypt project and the non-profit organization that
develops Certbot? We'd like to send you email about our work encrypting the web,
EFF news, campaigns, and ways to support digital freedom.

Requesting a certificate for realtime.example.com

Please deploy a DNS TXT record under the name:

_acme-challenge.realtime.example.com.

with the following value:

vmtY-V-ovR7tPT_TccXs3KzSLFDBxqYZNJrb7xfXjPI

Before continuing, verify the TXT record has been deployed. Depending on the DNS
provider, this may take some time, from a few seconds to multiple minutes. You can
check if it has finished deploying with aid of online tools, such as the Google
Admin Toolbox: https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/#TXT/_acme-challenge.realtime.example.com.
Look for one or more bolded line(s) below the line ';ANSWER'. It should show the
value(s) you've just added.

Press Enter to Continue
```

DO NOT press Enter, now, `certbot` need verify the DNS TXT record, we need to add the TXT record to our DNS provider, in this tutorial, we use [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), login to your Cloudflare account, then add the TXT record:

- Name: `_acme-challenge.realtime.example.com`
- Value: `vmtY-V-ovR7tPT_TccXs3KzSLFDBxqYZNJrb7xfXjPI`
- Type: `TXT`

After added, wait for a few seconds, open a new terminal, then run:

```bash
nslookup -type=TXT _acme-challenge.realtime.example.com
```

Check if the DNS record is ready. If it is ready, go back to your first terminal, press `Enter` to continue, you will see something like this:

```bash
Press Enter to Continue

Successfully received certificate.
Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/realtime.example.com/fullchain.pem
Key is saved at:         /etc/letsencrypt/live/realtime.example.com/privkey.pem
This certificate expires on 2023-11-01.
These files will be updated when the certificate renews.

NEXT STEPS:
- This certificate will not be renewed automatically. Autorenewal of --manual certificates requires the use of an authentication hook script (--manual-auth-hook) but one was not provided. To renew this certificate, repeat this same certbot command before the certificate's expiry date.

## Copy TLS certificates to your dev machine

```bash
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/realtime.example.com/fullchain.pem ./realtime.example.com.cert
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/realtime.example.com/privkey.pem ./realtime.example.com.key

sudo chown $USER:staff realtime.example.com.*
chmod 0644 realtime.example.com.*
```

## Verify the expiratioin time: 

```bashn
openssl x509 -enddate -noout -in realtime.example.com.cert
```
